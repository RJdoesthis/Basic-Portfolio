            Welcome to my page!
            My name is Rodney Julien, I'm a Haitian American born and raising in Boston Mass and an aspiring full stack
            developer. I have a background in Finance and Management which was obtained from my undergraduate days at
            the great University of Umass Lowell! Post graudation I secured a job at State Street Global Advisors as a
            Junior Business Analyst. With my finance background I was able to be successful in this role all while
            learning relational databases and SQL (Oracle).

            <br>
            <br>

            My love for technology grew as I continued to learn more and more. Today I work as a Senior Systems analyst
            at Boston Consulting Group. I was finally able to decide that I wanted to become a developer. I have plans
            to try and tap into our consulting division as the technology practice area is growing. I also have plans to
            work on my own projects with a close friend of mine.
